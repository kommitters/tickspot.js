# TogglTick
TogglTick is a Node.js client for [tickspot v2 api](https://github.com/tick/tick-api). 

## Installation

### Install via NPM
Get the package

```shell
$ npm i toggltick.js
```

Include the client at your application

```javascript
import Client from 'toggltick.js';
```
## Usage
Instance the Client with your subscription id, api token and user-agent email as following: 

```javascript
const client = new CLient({ subscriptionId: 'subscriptionId', apiToken: 'apiToken', agentEmail: 'agentEmail' })
```

### Entries
With the entries module you can use the following methods: 
- Create

  The create method creates an entry with the following data: 
  - date
  - hours: required*
  - notes: entry description
  - task_id: required*
  - user_id: will be ignored if the user is not an administrator

  Optionally, you can add a callback to handle the response data from the tickspot API. 

  For example: 
  ```javascript
  ...
  const data = {
  date: '2021-12-01',
  hours: 2,
  notes: 'Entry description',
  taskId: 12345678,
  };
  const dataCallback = (data) => data;

  client.entries.create(data, dataCallback);
  ```
  The create method returns a promise with the response data from the tickspot API or with your custom output data handled with the callback.
